# Prompts

1. load pytorch's cats and dogs images dataset as a preparation for a classification neural network using CNN.
2. modify the code to use keras instead
3. make the code run
4. Build a Sequential CNN with the layers depicted in the screenshot (Conv2D 32/64/128/128 + MaxPooling2D blocks, Flatten, Dense 512, Dense 2 softmax).
5. Generate an image showing the network architecture.
6. Train the model.
